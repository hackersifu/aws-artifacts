# s3 lockdown (hackersifu_s3lockdown.py)

This script is designed to be inside a Lambda function, and invoked to lockdown public permissions inside S3 buckets. It's recommended for organizations that have ***absolutely no need*** to have their S3 buckets public.
I'll be developing this script more to include features such as looking for tags, etc.
